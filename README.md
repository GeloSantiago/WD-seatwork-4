## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
The first page is where you will you locate the landing page and for the second page is where will you locate the key feature infos of the animals. Moose, reindeer, elephants, and leopards are remarkable animals each with unique characteristics and habitats. Moose, the largest members of the deer family, are found in northern regions such as Canada, Alaska, and Scandinavia, thriving in forests and wetlands. Reindeer, also known as caribou in North America, are adapted to cold Arctic and subarctic environments, where they migrate vast distances in search of food. Elephants, the largest land animals, are distinguished by their long trunks, large ears, and tusks, and are native to Africa and Asia, inhabiting diverse landscapes from savannas to forests. Leopards, with their distinctive spotted coats, are highly adaptable big cats found in Africa and parts of Asia, known for their solitary and elusive nature. Each of these animals plays a crucial role in their ecosystems, from the forest-dwelling moose shaping vegetation patterns to the powerful elephant engineering their habitats, while leopards and reindeer contribute to the biodiversity of their respective regions.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
